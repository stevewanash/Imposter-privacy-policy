        <!-- Section 1: Information We Collect -->

        <p class="mb-4 text-lg p-3 bg-green-50 text-green-800 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500">
            <strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information, usage data, or any other data from users of our App.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
            The App is designed to function entirely without the need to access or process any data from your device, with the exception of the standard non-personal data necessary for the App to function and install, which is not accessible to us.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Because we do not collect any personal data, the following standard privacy policy elements are not applicable to this App:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li><strong>No Collection of Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, precise location, photos, contacts, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
            <li><strong>No Use of Third-Party Services/Analytics:</strong> The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services that would gather information from users.</li>
            <li><strong>No Use of Cookies or Tracking Technologies:</strong> We do not use cookies or any similar tracking technologies.</li>
            <li><strong>No Sharing of Information:</strong> Since we do not collect any information, we have no information to share with any third parties.</li>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Our App is intended for users who are **13 years of age and older**. The Google Play Store's Family Policy allows for content to be rated for these ages.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
            Because the App does not collect any personal information whatsoever, it adheres to the spirit of relevant international privacy laws concerning children's privacy. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected any personal information from a user under the age of 13, we will delete that information immediately.
        </p>
